# Mandelbulb-Juliabulb-and-Logisticbulb

This is my undergraduate thesis at Boston University. The thesis is in the releases. The codes are used to plot the three-dimensional counterpart of the filled Julia set, the Mandelbrot set, and the logistic map by using spherical iterations.


# Abstract of the thesis

The Julia set has been studied by mathematicians for more than 100 years. Initially discovered by Gaston Julia, it couldn't be plotted at the time. Benoit Mandelbrot later created the Mandelbrot set, which remained unvisualized until 1980, despite its close relationship with the Julia set. The logistic map gained popularity through Robert May's work and shares similarities with the Mandelbrot set. Despite their simple formulas, these systems exhibit highly complex behavior due to their discrete dynamical nature and iterative construction. Mathematicians strive to prove various theorems to study them individually and explore their interconnections.

In this thesis, our goal is to plot these sets in three dimensions using spherical iterations and generalize the properties of the Mandelbrot set, the Julia set, and the logistic map to their three-dimensional counterparts. Furthermore, we seek to investigate whether they also exhibit relationships in three dimensions.
